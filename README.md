# LazerTripWire
Overview
This project is a laser trip wire system that uses a Laser Diode, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), and Servo Motors. The system can be used for security purposes, triggering alarms, or activating mechanisms when the laser beam is interrupted. When the laser beam is broken, the system detects the change in light intensity via the LDRs and responds by moving the servo motors, which can be configured to perform various actions (e.g., sounding an alarm, locking a door).

Components
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
Laser Diode - Emits a focused laser beam
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) - Detects changes in light intensity
Servo Motors - Perform actions when the trip wire is triggered
Resistors - For LDR circuit stabilization
Buzzer (Optional) - For audible alarms
Wires and Breadboard - For connections
Features
Laser-based Trip Wire: Detects any interruption in the laser beam.
Servo Motor Activation: Moves the servos upon detection.
Adjustable Sensitivity: LDRs can be calibrated for various lighting conditions.
Optional Alarms: Can connect to buzzers or other alert systems.
